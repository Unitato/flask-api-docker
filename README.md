# Flask API with Docker

## Overview
This is a simple Flask API server that allows you to execute bash commands within a Docker container. It provides an HTTP endpoint to send commands and retrieve the output.

## Detailed Application Description
The application uses Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, to create the API server. It accepts POST requests with JSON payloads containing the desired command to execute. The server runs the command within the Docker container and returns the output as a JSON response.

## Installation
To install and run the Flask API with Docker, follow these steps:

```shell
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/flask-api-docker.git](https://github.com/your-username/flask-api-docker.git)
cd flask-api-docker
docker build -t my-api-container .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it --rm my-api-container
```


## Deployment
To deploy the Flask API with Docker to a production environment, consider the following steps:

1. Customize the Flask API to suit your specific requirements. Update the `api.py` file to include additional functionality, security measures, and error handling.

2. Update the Dockerfile and include any additional dependencies required by your Flask application in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. Deploy the Docker container to your production environment, ensuring that you have the necessary infrastructure and networking configurations in place.


**Execute a command:**

```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"command": "ls -l"}' http://localhost:8080/execute
```
